# Pandas DataFrames in Jupyter Notebooks

- Pre-workshop activities: 10 min 
- Introductory presentation: 15 min
- Hands-on activities: 30-60 min

## Why Pandas? Why Jupyter Notebook? 

[Pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/) is an open-source Python library for data structuring and analysis. Its capabilities are flexible and can be integrated with other Python Libraries. It is also efficient for automating repetitive processes.

[Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is a web-based environment for interactive computing that helps researchers and scientists easily view programming output. In contrast to traditional programming environments, users can view output one sectuion at a time, which can help for breaking down tasks and debugging. There is no need for console knowledge.

This workshop uses the [uvic.syzygy.ca](https://uvic.syzygy.ca/) Jupyter Notebook software because it is free for Uvic students and staff to use and avoids the additional hassle of downloading new software. Notebooks are available on [other platforms](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Notebook_interface).

## Learning objectives:

At the end of this workshop, you will be able to:

1. Input and output code in Jupyter Notebook
2. Understand the use cases of the Pandas library
3. Upload a CSV or Excel file as a dataframe in a python notebook
4. Output properties of a dataframe
5. Delete and add rows and columns to a dataframe
6. Create 1 visualization using the data from the dataframe
